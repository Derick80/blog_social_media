## S3-Image Upload
I used a combination of the newer remix docs and the video/github code
  - I used the [remix-s3-uploader](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/examples/file-and-s3-upload)

### Unused resources
 These are resources or code that I wrote/used but did not end up using in the final product.  I am leaving them here for reference.
- Comments code
- Audio player code
## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app
server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

I tried to cite all sources used but if I missed one, please let me know and I will add it.  Thanks!
