    1. Real reason - Iâ€™m stubborn
    2. I tried Wix but didnâ€™t enjoy the feel of the editor even when I turned on the more developer friendly settings
    3. Astro is something that has been poking at my interests but I didnâ€™t understand how I might actually use it in this project
        1. More on this later though because one of the Astro templates helped me
            1. Go through the process of learning the very basics of Astro and along the way my brain was processing how I might be able to use the exposure (seeing a site, copying that site for practice) to inform my coding process for my blog
2. What are my main wants for V1 of the personal blog?
    1. Personal Login, a feeds page, a drafts page, a profile/about page'`,
